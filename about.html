    <p>Hi, I'm Darryn Noble.</p>

      Technology enthusiast. Likes music too.</p>
    <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>

    <br>
    <p>This blog has been in my cross-hairs for a number of years. With new found
       time on my hands, I've been able to pour myself into new creative endeavours
       like thoughtsome.ca</p>

    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>My career and worklife have spanned many dimensions of the software industry
       &#8212 implementation services, product managemnet, sales, and marketing
       supporting the finanacial services industry. I have developed expertise
       in customer relationship management and engagement solutions, portfolio
       management and measurement, and front-office solutions supporting the
       wealth management, commercial, corporate, and institutional bankging
       lines of business. I've been forrunate to travel the world to work with
       my prospects and clients. And I <strong>LOVE</strong> POCs! Nothing fires
       the competitive spirit quite like a head-to-head "bake-off" against
       the biggest and best in the industry!</p>
       <p>At home, my interests include web developement, the internet, astronomy,
       and music. I spend a lot of time thinking about, talking about, and dabbling
       with new ideas. That's really what led to this blog. I "though some" and
       wanted to share my perspective with you!</p>
       <p> Thank you for taking a momemnt to spend some time with me. I hope
       I add something unique and memorable to your day.</p>
